Hi! I'm Peter, a mathematics student at the University of Adelaide. I go on a lot of maths adventures, and I will be using this website as a platform to share some of the highlights. 

There isn't too much going on here at the moment but go check out my first blog post. If you enjoy a mixture of graph theory, optimisation and football, then it's definitely worth having a look. 

To test out my maths markdown, here is a fun definition Euler's number,

$e = \lim_{n \to \infty}\left(1+\frac{1}{n}\right)^n = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{1}{n!}$
